# GoPro_Transfer
Transfer files from a GoPro to a PC via WiFi

Works with Hero 5 Black and Max 360.  
Only transfers time lapse and burst photos.

Note: Hero 5 was not working using higher level `goprocam` library functions to download sequences hence the `hand rolled` nature of the download compared to the Max version.
