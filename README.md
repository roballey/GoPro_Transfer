# GoPro_Transfer
Transfer files from a GoPro to a PC via WiFi

Works with Hero 5 Black and Max 360.  
Only transfers time lapse and burst photos.

Note: Hero 5 was not working using higher level `goprocam` library functions to download sequences hence the hand rolled nature of the download compared to the Max version.

Uses [gopro-ble-py](https://github.com/roballey?tab=stars#:~:text=KonradIT%20/%20gopro%2Dble%2Dpy) and [gopro-py-api](https://github.com/KonradIT/gopro-py-api) (`goprocam`)
